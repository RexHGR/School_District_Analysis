Overview of the school district analysis

The purpose of the school district analysis is to facilitate rich and deep collaborative discussions among staff members about school data, by doing this teachers understand their students learning abilities and challenges, this process allows for identifying gaps and improvements which allow for a more comprehensive understanding of performance overall among students and teachers alike while also reducing floating data which likely disrupts the accuracy of the analysis.


How is the school summary affected?


Thomas school displays a decrease in performance, both areas; maths and reading.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Performance on Thomas High School underscores as it fails to report grades therefore performance is not measured completely.

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores were significantly higher in ninth graders, both reading and math.

Scores by school spending
Spending ranges for <$584 imply higher scores, spending above calls for a drop of .08% which indicates need for optimizatios; results can be achieved by spending less.

Scores by school size
Small schools allocate resources more efficiently which allows for precise perfomance monitoring while ensuring spending / passing ratio.
Medium to large schools display a drop mostly in large schools in overall passing.

Scores by school type
Charter schools perform most efficiently than district schools by capping student capacity and focusing on course development thoroughly.

Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

Nans imply poor / non existent evaluation and performance criteria, therefore no objective evaluation can be applied.

Ninth graders often showed higher scores compared to higher grades.
Charter schools allocate resources more efficiently as they operate through capped admission, this ensured proper review and evaluation criteria.
Smaller schools tend to monitor students accordingly and also optimize spending.
